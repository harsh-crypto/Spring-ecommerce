They are among the most charismatic of marine animals, inhabiting beaches, rocky shores and the deep sea, hiding under stones, burrowing in the sediment and nestling in among algae and many other microhabitats. However, most are difficult to identify by the specialist and amateur naturalist alike."Marine Decapod Crustacea" explains the anatomical features necessary for differentiating taxa and includes diagnoses and identification keys to all 189 families and 2121 genera of marine Decapoda. Many decapods have vivid colours, which are showcased in a selection of spectacular photographs of many representative species.This volume provides an entry to the literature for taxonomists, naturalists, consultants, ecologists, teachers and students wanting to identify local faunas and understand this diverse group.  aDescription from eBook on CSIRO Publishing page (viewed November 2022) 7aWildlife: general interest.2thema 0aDecapoda (Crustacea)vIdentification. 0aDecapoda (Crustacea)vClassification. 0aDecapoda (Crustacea)xEvolution. 0aCrustaceaxEvolution. 0aExotic marine organisms. 0aStomatopodavIdentification. 0aStomatopodavClassification.  aAustralian 4aElectronic books1 aAhyong, Shane T.,eauthor.2 aCSIRO Publishing,eissuing body.403Full textuhttps://ebooks.publish.csiro.au/content/ISBN/978148631179802300cam a2200421 i 4500001001300000003000900013005001700022007001500039008004100054020002400095020002400119020002900143040003700172042000900209082002000218100003200238245006200270263001100332264005100343300006300394336002600457337002600483338003600509347001200545504002000557520079400577588007501371650005701446650003901503650003901542650005001581650003901631650006101670653001501731655002101746710003701767856007401804000072328002AuCNLKIN20221213143125.0cr || ||||||||220809s2023    vraa          |01 ||eng    a9781486316861qepdf  a9781486316878qepub  a9781486316854qpaperback  aANL:PDSbengerdacANL:PDSdVCAV  aanuc04a584.15099452221 aBackhouse, Gary N,eauthor.10aGuide to Native Orchids of Victoria /cGary N, Backhouse.  a202302 1aClayton South, VIC :bCSIRO Publishing,c2023.  a1 online resource (viii, 320 pages : colour illustrations)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  a62.9 MB  aIncludes Index.  aThis comprehensive guide describes the 447 species of wild orchids that occur in Victoria, Australia.

These megafires burnt more than 10 million hectares, mostly of forests in southern and eastern Australia. Many of the fires were uncontrollable. These megafires affected many of Australia's most important conservation areas and severely impacted threatened species and ecological communities. They were a consequence of climate change - and offered a glimpse of how this is likely to continue to affect our future."Australia's Megafires" includes contributions by more than 200 researchers and managers with direct involvement in the management and conservation of the biodiversity affected by the Black Summer wildfires. It provides a comprehensive review of the impacts of these fires on all components of biodiversity, and on Indigenous cultural values.These fires also triggered an extraordinary and highly collaborative response by governments, NGOs, Indigenous groups, scientists, landholders and others, seeking to recover the fire-affected species and environments - to restore Country. This book documents that response. It draws lessons that should be heeded to sustain that recovery and to be better prepared for the inevitable future comparable catastrophes. Such lessons are of global relevance, for wildfires increasingly threaten biodiversity and livelihoods across the globe.  aDescription from eBook on CSIRO Publishing page (viewed December 2022) 7aNature & the natural world: general interest.2thema 7aWildlife: general interest.2thema 0aWildfireszAustralia. 0aWildfiresxPrevention and controlzAustralia. 0aNatural disastersxSocial aspectszAustralia. 0aForests and forestryxFire managementzAustralia. 0aForest fireszAustraliaxPrevention and control. 0aAboriginal AustraliansxSocial life and customs. 0aFire ecologyzAustralia. 0aNatural disastersxEnvironmental aspectszAustralia. 0aAltruistic behavior in animals.  aAustralian 4aElectronic books1 aRumpff, Libby,eeditor.1 aLegge, Sarah M.,eeditor.1 aLeeuwen, Stephen van,eeditor.1 aWintle, Brendan A.,eeditor.1 aWoinarski, John C.

In recent years, its taxonomic position, ecology, behaviour and body size have all been re-examined scientifically, while advances in genetics have presented the potential for de-extinction.With 78 contributors, "Thylacine: The History, Ecology and Loss of the Tasmanian Tiger" presents an evidence-based profile of the thylacine, examining its ecology, evolution, encounters with humans, persecution, assumed extinction and its appearance in fiction. The final chapters explore the future for this iconic species - a symbol of extinction but also hope.  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aDescription from eBook on CSIRO Publishing page (viewed January 2023) 0aThylacine. 0aExtinct animals.\\aEndangered species.\\aExtinct animal species. 0aThylacinexBehaviorzAustraliazTasmania. 0aMarsupialszAustraliazTasmania. 0aThylacinexAnatomy.  aAustralian 4aElectronic books1 aHolmes, Branden,eeditor.1 aLinnard, Gareth,eeditor.2 aCSIRO Publishing,eissuing body.403Full textuhttps://ebooks.publish.csiro.au/content/ISBN/978148631554302544cam a22004458i 4500001001300000003000900013005001700022007001500039008004100054020002400095020002400119020002900143040003700172042000900209082001500218100002500233245005400258263001100312264005100323300006700374336002600441337002600467338003600493347001300529504005100542520097200593588007401565650003601639650002601675650005201701650004701753650005401800650003501854650003201889653001501921655002101936700003001957710003701987856007402024000072806090AuCNLKIN20230117134114.0cr || ||||||||221012s2023    vrap   j      |0  ||eng    a9781486317080qepdf  a9781486317097qepub  a9781486317073qpaperback  aANL:PDSbengerdacANL:PDSdVCAV  aanuc04a523.782231 aLomb, Nick,eauthor.10aEclipse Chasers /cNick Lomb and Toner Stevenson.  a202303 1aClayton South, VIC :bCSIRO Publishing,c2023.  a1 online resource (xv, 198 pages : colour illustrations, maps)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  a11.98 MB  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  aWitnessing a total solar eclipse is a wondrous and unforgettable event!"Eclipse Chasers" is a guide to past and future Australian total solar eclipses, exploring historical and cultural knowledge, as well as featuring five upcoming eclipses that will be visible in Australia.The science of eclipses is explained, as well as how to prepare for an eclipse and view it safely.
